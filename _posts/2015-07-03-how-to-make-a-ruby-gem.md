This document describes the process of creating and managing a [Ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/).

## Generating

```` sh
bundle gem mygem
cd mygem
````

## Describing

Update *mygem.gemspec*, specifically the summary, description, and homepage attributes.

Update *README.md* to describe desired functionality.

## Writing

Make the library do what you said it would do. Revise *README.md* as necessary.

Have fun!

## Testing

The gem generation process configures much of the rspec test suite for you.

Create one or more rspec tests (*spec/myclass_spec.rb*) using the following template:

    require 'spec_helper'

    Mygem
      RSpec.describe Myclass do
        describe '#all' do
          it "does some stuff" do
            expect(true)
          end
        end
      end
    end

Run tests.

```` sh
bundle exec rspec spec/
````

## Debugging

Revise *mygem.gemspec* to include the following development dependencies:

    spec.add_development_dependency "pry", "~> 0.10"

To facilitate debugging inside tests, revise *spec/spec_helper.rb* to include:

    require 'pry'

To use pry instead of IRB as the default console, revise *bin/console* to include:

    require 'pry'
    Pry.start

Start the console.

    bin/console

> If debugging in a rails console, revise teh rails application's *Gemfile* to include:
 `gem 'mygem', '~> 0.0.1', :path => '../mygem'`

## Documenting

Write comments above public-facing methods according to the [YARD](http://yardoc.org/) specification.

Revise *mygem.gemspec* to include the following development dependency:

    spec.add_development_dependency "yard"

After installing with `bundle install`, run `bundle exec yard doc` to parse comments and/or `bundle exec yard server` to view documentation at *localhost:8808*.

## Versioning and Releasing

Edit gem version in *lib/mygem/version.rb*.

Run `bundle exec rake release` to auto-generate git tag and push to github and rubygems.
