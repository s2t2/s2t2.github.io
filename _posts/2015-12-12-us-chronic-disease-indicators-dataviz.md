![a choropleth map showing mental health indicators by state](/assets/images/us-chronic-disease-indicators.png "US Chronic Disease Indicators")

A visualization of mental-health-related [data](http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-chronic-disease-indicators-cdi) from from data.gov, created during a [Mental Health Hackathon](http://washington.impacthub.net/event/white-house-ostp-mentalhealthhackathon/) organized by the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy.

Through participating in this project, I learned that the government is collecting data on the number of "recent mentally unhealthy days" for the average citizen, by state.

Despite an outstanding question about the definition of "recent", which would put more context behind the numbers, the data shows around three to five recent days for each person on average.

My hope is that this simple map helps bring awareness to the fact that it's normal for the average person to have at least a few "down" days every now and then.
