This document describes the process of creating a new Ruby on Rails application from scratch, using Rails version 4.2.0. Replace `MY_APP` below with the name of your app, `MY_NAME` with your name, and `MY_EMAIL` with your email address.

## Generating

Create a new app and set up version control.

```` sh
bundle exec rails new MY_APP --database=mysql
cd MY_APP/
git init .
git add .
git commit -m "generating new rails app"
````

Create and edit **README.md**, and **LICENSE.md**. For the license, use this MIT template:

```` sh
git commit -m "adding documentation"
````

## Configuring

### Managing Back-end Packages

Revise **Gemfile** to add ruby version, and [rubygems](https://rubygems.org/)
 like 'pry' for debugging, 'rspec-rails' for testing, and 'yard' for documentation.

```` rb
# Gemfile
# ...
ruby "2.2.0"
# ...
gem 'yard', group: :doc # run `bundle exec yard doc` to parse comments and/or `bundle exec yard server` to view documentation at *localhost:8808*
# ...
group :development, :test do
  # ...
  gem 'pry'
  gem 'rspec-rails', '~> 3.0'
end
````

Install gems via *bundler*:

```` sh
bundle install
````

#### Configuring Documentation

```` sh
bundle exec yard doc
````

Remove documentation from source control by adding a file at *.yardoc/.gitignore* and *doc/.gitignore* with the following contents:

    # Ignore everything in this directory
    *
    # Except this file
    !.gitignore

#### Configuring the Database

Ensure existence of the database user and password specified in **/config/database.yml**, using the command line or relational database management software as necessary.

Create the development and test environment databases.

```` sh
bundle exec rake db:create
````

#### Configuring the Test Suite

Finish rspec installation. Refer to [rspec installation instructions](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails#installation) as necessary.

```` sh
bundle exec rails generate rspec:install
````

Remove tests directory.

```` sh
rm -rf test/
````

Configure generators in **config/application.rb**.

```` rb
# configure generators ...
config.generators do |g|
  g.test_framework :rspec
  g.assets = false
  g.helper = false
end
````

Run tests to ensure proper configuration.

```` sh
bundle exec rspec spec/
````

Commit the configurations.

```` sh
git commit -m "configuring tests and database"
````

### Managing Front-end Packages

Create a file called **package.json** in the root directory, optionally generating with `npm init`:

    {
      "name": "my-app",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "dependencies": {
        "bower": "~1.4"
      },
      "engine": {
        "node": "0.12.7",
        "npm": "2.12.1"
      },
      "scripts": {
        "postinstall": "./node_modules/bower/bin/bower install"
      }
    }

Create a file called *bower.json* in the root directory, optionally generating with `bower init`:

    {
      "name": "my-app",
      "dependencies": {
        "bootstrap": "~3.3.4",
        "d3": "~3.5.5",
        "jquery": "~2.1.4",
        "jquery.ui": "~1.11.4",
        "octicons": "*"
      }
    }


Create a file called *.bowerrc* in the root directory of your app, to resemble the following template:

    {
      "directory": "vendor/assets/components"
    }

Install components with `bower install`. Alternatively run `npm install`, which, if **package.json** is configured according to the template above, will also perform a bower installation.

Require components in *app/assets/javascripts/application.js*:

    //= require d3/d3

> NOTE: place all component require statements above `//= require_tree .`

Remove installed node modules and bower components from source control by adding a file at *node_modules/.gitignore* and *vendor/assets/components/.gitignore* with the following contents:

    # Ignore everything in this directory
    *
    # Except this file
    !.gitignore

Commit the configurations.

```` sh
git commit -m "configuring front-end packages"
````

## Writing

That's it. Now start coding your custom app.

Write [rspec tests](http://betterspecs.org/) as necessary.

Write comments above public-facing methods as necessary, according to the [yard](http://yardoc.org/) documentation specification.
